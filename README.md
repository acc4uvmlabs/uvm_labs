# uvm_labs
Please note:
These labs will help you use SV/UVM constructs. 
Will help you get comfortable with UVM simulations. 
We are here to make UVM learning easier. :) 

Who is the target audience? 
Anybody who wants to learn UVM, a student, professional engineers, beginners, etc. 

How you can use these labs: 
1. Follow instructions mentioned in README_FIRST.txt or instructions inside the files. 
We have tried giving as many instructions as possible. 
All the files are templated using Python script. 

We have practiced these labs with multiple simulator, you can use any simulator that's available to you. 
We have also provided a sample run script. It is executable. 
Command to simulate a script:  ./run

There is always a scope for improvement, please excuse us for any inconvenience. :)
